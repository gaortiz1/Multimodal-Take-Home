## 7. **Containerization & Deployment (Conceptual)**

### 7.1. Containerization with Docker

To containerize this service, we use a **multi-stage Docker build**:

- **Build Stage:**
  - Install build-time dependencies (e.g., compile wheels, native libs).
  - Prepare the application code and environment.

- **Runtime Stage:**
  - Use a lightweight image (`python:3.10-slim` or similar).
  - Copy only production code and installed dependencies from the build stage.
  - Use `gunicorn` with `UvicornWorker` for optimal performance in FastAPI.

**Key Concerns for the `Dockerfile`:**

- **Image Size:**
  - Remove cache and unnecessary files.
  - Use slim or distroless base images.

- **Security:**
  - Avoid running as root.
  - Do not bake secrets into the image.
  - Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities.

- **Health & Readiness:**
  - Include a healthcheck script or `/health` endpoint.
  - Use Dockerâ€™s `HEALTHCHECK` instruction if needed.

- **Environment Management:**
  - Inject configuration via environment variables or mounted files.
  - Use Docker labels to add metadata (e.g., version, commit hash).

### 7.2. Deployment Strategy

#### Option 1: **Kubernetes**

- **API Module:**
  - Deployed as a `Deployment`, exposed via a `Service` and `Ingress`.

- **Worker Module (Celery):**
  - Deployed as a `Deployment` or `StatefulSet` for controlled scaling.

**Scalability & Observability:**

- Use **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** for the API based on CPU or latency.
- Use **KEDA** or custom metrics to scale Celery workers based on queue depth.
- Monitor using **RabbitMQ UI**, **Flower**, **Prometheus**, and **Grafana**.

**Secrets & Networking:**

- Use `Secrets` for sensitive data and `ConfigMaps` for configs.
- Define `NetworkPolicies` to control traffic flow between services.

#### Option 2: **AWS ECS / Fargate**

- Define **separate ECS tasks** for API and Celery workers.
- Use **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for the API service.

**Autoscaling:**

- Use ECS Service Auto Scaling based on CPU for API.
- Scale workers based on RabbitMQ queue length.

**Security & Configuration:**

- Use **Secrets Manager** or **SSM Parameter Store** for credentials.
- Assign **IAM roles** (Task Role, Execution Role) for AWS access.
